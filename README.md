## Hi!
I'm Liantsoa, and I am a high energy physics student.
My long term goal is to do research in Quantum Gravity/Quantum Information.
I'm currently learning QFT, General Relativity, Particle Physics and Mathematics (mostly Fiber Bundles, Group Theory)
I'm also interested in learning more about Information theory/ Machine Learning and Statistical Mechanics/Complex Systems

Here are some quotes that I like  😄:
>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" A.Einstein
>"Our purpose in theoretical physics is not to describe the world as we find it, but to
 explain– in terms of a few fundamental principles– why the world is the way it is." Steven Weinberg
